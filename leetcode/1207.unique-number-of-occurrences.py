#
# Given an array of integers arr, return true if the number of occurrences of
# each value in the array is unique or false otherwise.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The value 1 has 3 occurrences, 2 has 2 and 3 has 1. No two
# values have the same number of occurrences.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [1,2]
# Output: false
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: arr = [-3,0,1,-3,1,1,1,-3,10,0]
# Output: true
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= arr.length <= 1000
# -1000 <= arr[i] <= 1000
# 
#

class Solution:
    def uniqueOccurrences(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        from collections import Counter
        c = list(Counter(arr).values())
        return len(c) == len(set(c))

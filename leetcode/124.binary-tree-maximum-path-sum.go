 *
 * A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent
 * nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in
 * the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through
 * the root.
 *
 * The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any
 * non-empty path.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [1,2,3]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 =
 * 6.
 *
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: 42
 * Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 +
 * 7 = 42.
 *
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
 * -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

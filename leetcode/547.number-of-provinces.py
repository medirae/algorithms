# There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.
# 
# A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.
# 
# You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.
# 
# Return the total number of provinces.
# 
#  
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
# Output: 2
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
# Output: 3
# 
# 
#  
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 	1 <= n <= 200
# 	n == isConnected.length
# 	n == isConnected[i].length
# 	isConnected[i][j] is 1 or 0.
# 	isConnected[i][i] == 1
# 	isConnected[i][j] == isConnected[j][i]

# Testcase Example:  '[1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0]\n2'
#
# Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of
# consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most k 0's.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
# Output: 6
# Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
# Output: 10
# Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
# Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is
# underlined.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
# 0 <= k <= nums.length
# 
#

class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        left = right = cz = maximum = 0
        while left <= right and right < n:
            while right < n and (nums[right] == 1 or cz < k):
                if nums[right] == 0:
                    cz += 1
                right += 1
            maximum = max(maximum, right - left)
            if nums[left] == 0 and cz > 0:
                cz -= 1
            left += 1
            right = max(right, left)
        return maximum
